# FlightPlan-Frontend
This application allows Career Services to provide for each student their Eagle Flight Plan. An individualized plan of tasks and experiences for each student based for the semester of school they are in. The idea of the Eagle Flight Plan is to help engage OC students beginning their Freshman semester with Career Services. Studies have shown that early engagement shows better outcomes for jobs post-graduation. This is due to the fact that they have had ample time to prepare, learn professional development, and build their network for four semesters instead of one or two semesters. Our goal in creating this is to have a unique way to complete all the necessary tasks to develop professionally. Everything would be located in one place, which would make it easy to use, it would track their individual progress which could motivate them and they would earn points along the way which could make it exciting to get the rewards.

Goals with the Eagle Flight Plan Students have a firm understanding of their strengths and have developed their personal skills. ● Students would have a polished resume and cover letter with references ● Students would have been able to grow their networks by attending events and career fairs on campus ● Students would have grown their leadership skills and understand the importance of gratitude ● Students would have the skills and ability to job search and confidently find a job
